Changelog
=========

19th July 2016:
	Updated to Puma 3.5
	Overhauled usage of permissions some more:
		- User and group has_permission? can now accept an array and will return true if any of the permissions are valid, and the group can check if the user has the permission globally.
		- Added has_global_permission? to both user and groups. Will check if the user has both local and global variant of a permission. Eg: enter "comment_own_posts" and it will check for that and "comment_all_users_posts".
	Cleanup of code in views with permission usage.
	Completely rewrote notification system. Dumps all the notification table and creates a new one. We didn't have many anyway. Now vastly more flexible and extensible. Has a hstore data field for general extensible data usage if needed, layouts are done in the _notifications partial rather than a string from the model. This allows each notification type to have it's own partial of sorts. Notification partials are also cached.
	Fixed the "Forgot my Password" link layoug on the login form. Should not break and newline anymore.
	Fixed caching bug on comments, where they displayed the avatar as the original poster.
